### Purpose

This application can be used for demostration purposes, as a starting point for creating a CEM implementation or as inspiration for how to implement a CEM in another programming language. Please bare in mind that this example is not complete; not all EFI Storage features are implemented.

### Used technologies
Apache Maven to download dependencies, generate code and to build the application. JAXB is used for parsing and generating XML. Jetty is used as the websocket client. The graphical user interface is implented using Java Swing.
